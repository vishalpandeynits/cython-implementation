Implemented function in Cython to make python faster(Learning Repo)

### What is Cython ?
Cython is a programming language that makes writing C extensions for the Python
language as easy as Python itself. It aims to become a superset of the Python
language which gives it high-level, object-oriented, functional, and dynamic 
programming. Its main feature on top of these is support for optional static type
declarations as part of the language. The source code gets translated into optimized
C/C++ code and compiled as Python extension modules. This allows for both very fast
program execution and tight integration with external C libraries, while keeping up
the high programmer productivity for which the Python language is well known.
